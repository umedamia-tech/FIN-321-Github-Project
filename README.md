## Executive Summary

Our firm faces foreign exchange exposure on a €4,500,000 receivable due in one year from our European solar equipment contract. At today's spot rate (1.1607 USD/EUR), this represents $5,223,150, but the forward market prices EUR at 1.0875, suggesting a potential $329,400 loss. I recommend implementing a forward contract hedge to eliminate this risk and ensure predictable cash flows.

## Background & Objectives

We will receive €4,500,000 in twelve months from our European customer. As a U.S. company operating in USD, exchange rate fluctuations create significant uncertainty. The current environment presents structural headwinds: the Fed maintains rates at 4.25% while the ECB rate sits at 2.15%, creating a 210-basis-point differential favoring USD strength. 

In a worst-case scenario where EUR falls to 1.05, we could lose nearly $500,000 in value—representing 9.5% erosion of expected proceeds. This unhedged exposure creates earnings volatility that complicates financial guidance and may concern investors. Our objective is to eliminate FX risk and protect profit margins while maintaining cost-effective hedging.

## Methods

I evaluated three hedging strategies using current market data:

**Forward Contract:** Lock in 1.0875 rate, guaranteeing $4,893,750. *Pros:* Zero upfront cost, complete certainty. *Cons:* No upside if EUR strengthens.

**Put Option:** Strike at 1.1607 with $67,500 premium, guaranteeing minimum $5,155,650 net. *Pros:* Downside protection with upside potential. *Cons:* Significant premium cost.

**Money Market Hedge:** Borrow €4.4M at 2.15%, convert at spot, invest at 3.55%. Projects $5,295,158. *Pros:* Best economics. *Cons:* High complexity, uses credit lines.

## Limitations & Next Steps

**Limitations:** Forward rate (1.0875) assumes stable market conditions; actual execution may vary by 10-20 basis points. Forward contracts provide no flexibility if payment timing changes. All strategies assume payment occurs as scheduled on the one-year maturity date.

**Recommendation:** Implement forward contract for zero-cost certainty and risk elimination.

**Next Steps:** Treasury Department to obtain CFO approval by October 25, secure competitive quotes from three banks by October 28, and execute forward contract by October 30. Treasury will handle ongoing hedge accounting documentation and monthly monitoring.
