# Foreign Exchange Hedge Analysis: Executive Memo
## EUR 4.5M Receivable | Strategic Recommendation

---

## A. EXPOSURE SUMMARY

**Transaction Details:**
- **Foreign Currency Receivable:** EUR 4,500,000
- **Payment Timing:** 1-year maturity (365 days)
- **Current Spot Rate:** 1.1607 USD/EUR
- **Unhedged USD Value:** $5,223,150

**FX Risk Profile:**

The company faces EUR/USD exchange rate risk on this receivable. If the euro depreciates against the dollar over the next year, our USD cash flows will decline. At current spot rates, the receivable converts to $5.22M, but this is uncertain. A 5% EUR depreciation would reduce proceeds to $4.96M—a $260K loss. Conversely, EUR appreciation would increase proceeds, but this upside comes with downside exposure that threatens budget certainty and cash flow planning.

## B. HEDGE OUTCOMES COMPARISON

| Strategy | USD Proceeds | Upfront Cost | Net Economics |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Forward Contract** | $4,893,750 | $0 | $4,893,750 |
| **Put Option** | $5,155,650* | $67,500 | $5,088,150 |
| **Money Market** | $5,294,735 | Credit line | $5,294,735 |
| **Call Option** | $5,142,150 | $81,000 | $5,061,150 |

*Put option floor; unlimited upside if EUR strengthens

**Key Insights:**

**Forward Contract** locks in $4.89M with zero upfront cost and complete certainty—no better, no worse regardless of future spot rates. This is $329K below current spot conversion but eliminates all FX uncertainty.

**Money Market Hedge** delivers the best economics at $5.29M by exploiting the 140bp USD-EUR interest rate differential. The synthetic forward rate (1.1766) significantly exceeds the market forward (1.0875), suggesting the forward market is pricing in EUR weakness beyond interest rate parity. However, this requires borrowing EUR 4.41M today, occupying credit capacity.

**Put Option** provides asymmetric payoff: a floor of $5.16M (net of premium) with unlimited upside if EUR appreciates. At $67.5K premium (1.5 cents per EUR), this offers downside protection 5.4% above the forward rate while preserving upside participation.

**Call Option** is economically inferior for receivables—it caps upside while providing no downside protection, making it suitable only for payables, not receivables.

## C. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

**EUR Depreciation Scenarios (Downside Risk):**

When the euro weakens, the strategies diverge sharply:

- **At 1.1027 USD/EUR (-5%):** The unhedged position delivers only $4.96M. The forward contract provides $4.89M certainty. The put option's true value emerges: it guarantees $5.16M—exceeding both unhedged and forward outcomes by protecting against further EUR weakness while having locked in a better rate through the option structure.

- **At 1.1491 USD/EUR (-1%):** The unhedged position yields $5.17M, but the put begins to show its premium cost as the floor hasn't been needed. The forward remains at $4.89M.

The money market hedge delivers $5.29M regardless of spot movement, demonstrating its synthetic forward structure.

**EUR Appreciation Scenarios (Upside Opportunity):**

When the euro strengthens, downside protection becomes costly:

- **At 1.2187 USD/EUR (+5%):** The unhedged position captures full upside at $5.48M. The put option participates nearly fully, delivering $5.42M (upside minus $67.5K premium). The forward contract remains locked at $4.89M, forgoing $591K in potential gains. The money market similarly foregoes upside, fixed at $5.29M.

**Strategic Implication:**

The forward and money market hedges provide certainty at the cost of flexibility. The put option costs $67.5K but preserves upside—essentially purchasing insurance against EUR weakness while allowing participation in EUR strength. Whether this insurance is worthwhile depends on the firm's risk tolerance, cash flow needs, and EUR outlook.

## D. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

**Recommended Strategy: FORWARD CONTRACT**

I recommend executing a 1-year forward contract to sell EUR 4.5M at the forward rate of 1.0875 USD/EUR, locking in **$4,893,750** in USD proceeds.

**Supporting Data:**

1. **Certainty of Cash Flows:** Guaranteed $4.89M enables precise budget planning and eliminates FX volatility from quarterly earnings
2. **Zero Upfront Cost:** No premium payment; no impact on current liquidity or P&L
3. **Risk Elimination:** Removes 100% of FX exposure—critical for financial planning and covenant compliance
4. **Operational Simplicity:** Single contract execution; no ongoing monitoring or credit facility requirements

**Alternative Consideration:**

If management believes EUR appreciation is likely and wishes to participate in upside while protecting against downside, the **put option** merits consideration despite its $67.5K cost. The put establishes a $5.16M floor (17% above the forward guaranteed amount) while preserving unlimited upside. This strategy makes sense if:
- Cash flow forecasts can accommodate the premium expenditure
- Management has a bullish EUR outlook supported by analysis
- The firm values optionality and can accept premium cost as insurance expense

However, the forward remains superior for firms prioritizing certainty over speculation.

## E. EXECUTIVE JUSTIFICATION

**Business Case for Forward Contract:**

**1. Cash Flow Stability**

The forward contract transforms an uncertain EUR receivable into a certain $4.89M USD cash flow. This certainty is invaluable for:
- **Annual Budget Accuracy:** Finance can plan with precision, knowing exact USD proceeds
- **Covenant Compliance:** Eliminates risk of FX-driven covenant violations
- **Dividend Policy:** Supports stable dividend planning without FX uncertainty
- **Capital Allocation:** Enables confident commitment to strategic investments

In volatile FX markets, this certainty has tangible value that exceeds the opportunity cost of foregone upside.

**2. Budget Certainty vs. Speculation**

While the money market hedge yields $401K more in proceeds, it requires:
- EUR credit line access and associated costs
- Cross-currency funding management complexity
- Potential credit capacity constraints for other business needs
- Operational execution across multiple transactions (borrow, convert, invest)

The forward's simplicity and zero-cost structure make it the prudent baseline hedge.

The put option's $67.5K premium must be justified by genuine conviction in EUR appreciation. Unless FX strategy is a core competency and management has superior EUR forecasting ability, paying for optionality effectively makes the firm a speculator. Our core business is not FX trading—it's [business description]. The forward allows us to focus on operational excellence rather than currency views.

**3. Liquidity Preservation**

The forward requires no upfront cash outlay, preserving liquidity for:
- **Working Capital Needs:** No reduction in available cash
- **Strategic Opportunities:** Maintains financial flexibility for M&A or capex
- **Credit Facility Access:** No borrowing required, unlike the money market hedge

**4. Accounting & Hedge Effectiveness**

Under ASC 815 (hedge accounting), forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge treatment with high documentation simplicity:
- Clearly designated hedging relationship
- High hedge effectiveness (near-perfect offset)
- Simplified reporting: forward points amortized, spot locked
- Reduced earnings volatility compared to unhedged position

Put options require more complex fair value tracking and effectiveness testing, increasing accounting workload.

**5. Risk Profile Alignment**

Our treasury policy emphasizes **risk elimination** over **return optimization** for FX exposure. The forward contract aligns with this conservative mandate:
- **Risk Appetite:** Zero tolerance for FX volatility in core receivables
- **Shareholder Expectations:** Earnings predictability valued over speculative gains
- **Fiduciary Responsibility:** Protecting known cash flows rather than chasing uncertain upside

**Management Perspective:**

A CFO presentation should frame this as: *"We're locking in $4.89M today versus accepting $260K downside risk for the possibility of $260K upside—a symmetric bet we're not positioned to win consistently. Our competitive advantage lies in [core business], not FX forecasting. The forward contract ensures we deliver predictable results to shareholders."*

---

## CONCLUSION

The **forward contract** is the recommended hedge strategy based on the firm's need for certainty, liquidity preservation, and risk elimination. It transforms FX uncertainty into financial precision, enabling confident resource allocation and stable earnings delivery.

*This recommendation prioritizes financial stability and budget certainty over speculative upside capture, consistent with prudent corporate treasury management.*
